    "now that we have seen the key map and reduce operators in spark, and also know when to use transformation and action operators, we can revisit the word count problem we introduced earlier in the section. In this lab, we will use the methods seen in the coding labs to read a text corpus into spark environment, perform a word count and try basic NLP ideas to get a good grip on how MapReduce performs. \n",
